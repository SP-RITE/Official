# SP-RITE Github Website 2021/2022
Created by Poh Hian & Ethan Cheong

Dear future exco members that will eventually see this README.md file. 

The ambitious idea of having our own CCA Github website is unfortunate put to a stop due to the school disallowing CCAs to make their own websites due to regulation matters.
Hence the only way to publish a CCA website is through the school's sharepoint where other students can view the CCA content from.
